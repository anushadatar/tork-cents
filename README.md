# Tork-Cents
Olin College SP20 Digital Power Conversion Team Project completed by [Jamie Santiago](https://github.com/jgsantiagojr), [Riley Zito](https://github.com/RileyZito), [Jill MacGregor](https://github.com/jmacgregor21), and [Anusha Datar](https://github.com/anushadatar).

## Summary
This project involved designing and building a torque sensor. While the COVID-19 pandemic prevented this project from reaching its final stages, this repository contains test code, software associated with the project, and final documentation. 

The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P2dLgivyGD85DENp7XFNzaGc18PJQSH1JQpyHDQYsxE/edit?usp=sharing) for this project contain information about the prototyping process and final approach associated with this device, which uses dielectric magnetics and hall effect sensors to determine the phase shift caused by the deformation of a shaft undergoing static or dynamic torque. This shift directly correlates to the torque; calculating torque simply requires developing and applying a calibration curve.
